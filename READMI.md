# Hospital Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization for hospital data. It includes:
- Connecting to a MySQL database.
- Fetching and inserting hospital records.
- Performing basic statistical analysis.
- Creating visualizations using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

This project is ideal for demonstrating **data handling, analysis, and visualization capabilities** using Python.

---

## Features
- Inserts sample hospital data into MySQL.
- Computes descriptive statistics (mean, min, max, std) and correlation matrices.
- Handles missing data and converts categorical variables for analysis.
- Generates visualizations such as histograms and heatmaps.
- Provides a clear structure for integrating Python with a database.

---

## Project Structure
The project contains the following files:

- `Hospital_3.py` : Main Python script performing database operations, analysis, and visualizations.
- `requirements.txt` : Lists Python dependencies required for the project.
- `hospital_data.csv` : Sample dataset (auto-generated for demonstration purposes).
- `README.md` : Project documentation.
- `LICENSE` : MIT License for open-source usage.
- `.gitignore` : Specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git.

---

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaibhavchunekar/Hospital-Data-Analysis.git
cd Hospital-Data-Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
python Hospital_3.py

```

## Usage

- The script inserts sample data into the MySQL database.
- Displays descriptive statistics (mean, min, max, std) in the console.
- Shows correlation matrix.
- Generates visualizations such as histograms and heatmaps.

---

## Notes

- The included dataset is auto-generated; no sensitive data is used.
- Ensure MySQL server is running and the `hospital` database exists.
- Python 3.13+ is recommended.
